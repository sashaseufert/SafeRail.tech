        <p>Canada suffered from 527 non-main rail track derailments in 2016 alone. 13% of these derailments involved dangerous goods.</p>
        <p>Canada carries over 300 billion tonne-kilometres per year, which represents 68% of Canadian freight. Canada is among the heighest in the world of rail tonnage carried per capita and percentage of frieght carried by rail.</p>

             <strong><span class="countingNumber" data-count="1.7">1.7</span> Million</strong> litres of 
             crude oil released
             from cracked track
         </h1>
         <p>A CN unit train transporting 100 tank cars loaded with petroleum products derailed. It was travelling at 38 mph, below the 40 mph speed limit in place at the time. Twenty-nine tank cars of petroleum crude oil derailed and 19 of these breached, releasing 1.7 million litres of product. The crude oil ignited, resulting in fires that burned for 5 days.</p>
         <p>The investigation found that the derailment occurred when joint bars in the track failed. Pre-existing fatigue cracks in the joint bars at this location had gone unnoticed in previous inspections. Once the fatigue cracks reached a critical size, the combination of the cold temperatures (-31 °C) and repetitive impacts from train wheels passing over the joint caused the joint bars to fail. These defects went undetected as the training, on-the-job mentoring, and supervisory support that an assistant track supervisor received was insufficient.</p>

         <h1>The Saferail.tech unit is a remote IoT device that rides ahead of trains, using its array of onboard sensors to monitor tracks for damage and obstacles. </h1>
         <p>Upon detection of a hazard, the unit will alert the train within a safe  distance for engineers to stop, evaluate the risk, perform applicable repairs, and safely pass over or avoid the problem track</p>
         <h1>Key Features</h1>
         <ul>
             <li>Narrow and long form factor: aerodynamic profile can slice through snow and ice with ease</li>
             <li>Cross bar sensors can identify objects between the rails</li>
             <li>Failsafe mounting springs will eject unit from the tracks if battery dies</li>
             <li>Around-the-rail form factor locks to rail to prevent theft</li>
             <li>Side and front mounted infrared cameras can detect nearby animals to  sound  onboard siren and alert train</li>
             <li>Made of cast metal for decades of durability in all elements</li>
             <li>Can detect if the unit is stuck or derailed because of a railway fault</li>
             <li>Array of track sensors take detailed track analysis at high speed and feed data into ML algorithms to detect track anomalies</li>

    <h1>The Hack</h1>
    <p>Due to the size and scale of this project, we’re not building a hardware prototype this weekend. Instead, our hack opts to mock the hardware and focus on the circuit design in VHDL, create the hardware library and the data processing and ML pipeline</p>
